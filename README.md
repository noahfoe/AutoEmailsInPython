# AutoEmailsInPython

## Why Did I Make This?
My professor for my online summer class required us to send him an email for participation if we "participated" during the lecture (i.e. asking/answering questions, typing in zoom chat, etc). I got a little tired of copy and pasting the email everyday, sometimes forgetting to change the date and having to follow up with an extra email correcting the date (he made us put the date in the email, even though emails show the date they were sent on them). So, my solution was automating my outlook email to send him an email everyday. All i have to do now is press one button and my professor gets an email sent to him.

## What I Learned
* The "DateTime" Python Module
* The "win32com.client" Python Module (used for outlook)
* Exception Handling
* Automation of everyday tasks
